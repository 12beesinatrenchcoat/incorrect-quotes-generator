**a little web thing that inserts character names into prompts. because comedy.**

 ~~rips off~~ heavily inspired by [scatterpatter's incorrect quotes generator](https://incorrect-quotes-generator.neocities.org/). in fact, all of the prompts are stolen from his generator.

colors are from holllo's color theme, [love](https://love.holllo.cc/). (it's quite pretty!)
