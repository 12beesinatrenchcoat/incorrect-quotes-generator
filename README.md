**a little web thing that inserts character names into prompts. because comedy.**

 ~~rips off~~ heavily inspired by [scatterpatter's incorrect quotes generator](https://incorrect-quotes-generator.neocities.org/). in fact, all of the prompts are stolen from his generator.

colors are from (or are based on) holllo's color theme, [love](https://love.holllo.cc/). (it's quite pretty!) love is under the [MIT License](https://git.holllo.cc/Holllo/love/src/branch/main/LICENSE).

character colors (past character 6) are generated using [HSLuv](https://www.hsluv.org/). the javascript implementation and its license can be found in the [`./hsluv`](./hsluv) folder.
