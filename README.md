**A little overcomplicated web thing that inserts character names into prompts to make "incorrect quotes". Because comedy.**

 ~~Rips off~~ heavily inspired by [Scatterpatter's Incorrect Quotes Generator](https://incorrect-quotes-generator.neocities.org/) â€” in fact, all of the prompts are stolen from his generator.

Colors are from / based on Holllo's color theme, [Love](https://love.holllo.cc/). (It's quite pretty!) Love is under the [MIT License](https://git.holllo.cc/Holllo/love/src/branch/main/LICENSE).

The external link icon ("arrow-up-right-from-square") is from [Font Awesome 6.0](https://fontawesome.com/v6.0/icons/arrow-up-right-from-square?s=solid). Its SVG code is in the stylesheet.

## prompts
The [promptSets](./promptSets) directory contains the sets of prompts, each of which are formatted like:
```jsonc
{
	"title": "a title for this fine collection of prompts",
	"description": "an equally fine description",
	"url": "creator's url or something. attribution.",
	"prompts": {
		"1": [ // prompts grouped by how many characters are in them
			{ // text: String; tags: [String]
				"text": "{1}: boy do i like beans!",
				"tags": ["shipping", "swearing"] // optional.
			}
		]
	}
}
```

There's also [promptSetList.json](./promptSetList.json), containing all the loadable prompt sets.
